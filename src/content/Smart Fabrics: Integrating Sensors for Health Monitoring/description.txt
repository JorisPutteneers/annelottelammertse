    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
        The project aims to revolutionize the field of healthcare by integrating sensors into fabrics for continuous health monitoring. By embedding sensors within textiles, we aim to create smart fabrics capable of monitoring vital signs and health parameters seamlessly.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Research Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Developing textile-based sensor technologies for accurate health monitoring.</li>
        <li>Investigating methods for integrating sensors into various types of fabrics.</li>
        <li>Exploring wireless communication protocols for transmitting health data.</li>
        <li>Evaluating the usability and comfort of smart fabrics in daily life.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Methodology</h2>
    <p>
        The project will involve several phases, including sensor development, fabric integration, prototype testing, and user feedback collection. Advanced textile manufacturing techniques will be employed to embed sensors seamlessly into fabrics without compromising their comfort or functionality.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Expected Outcomes</h2>
    <p>
        The project is expected to yield smart fabrics capable of monitoring vital signs such as heart rate, respiration rate, and body temperature. These fabrics will provide real-time health data, enabling early detection of health issues and continuous monitoring of chronic conditions.
