    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
        This project focuses on addressing the environmental impact of traditional textile dyeing processes by developing sustainable dyeing techniques using natural pigments and eco-friendly processes. By reducing the use of harmful chemicals and minimizing water consumption, we aim to promote environmental sustainability in the textile industry.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Research Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Exploring natural sources of pigments suitable for textile dyeing.</li>
        <li>Developing eco-friendly dyeing processes that minimize water and energy consumption.</li>
        <li>Evaluating the colorfastness and durability of textiles dyed using natural pigments.</li>
        <li>Assessing the environmental impact of sustainable dyeing techniques compared to conventional methods.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Methodology</h2>
    <p>
        The project will involve sourcing natural pigments from various sources such as plants, minerals, and insects. These pigments will be tested for their suitability for textile dyeing, considering factors such as color vibrancy, fastness, and eco-friendliness. Eco-friendly dyeing processes, such as low-water immersion dyeing and natural mordanting, will be developed and optimized to achieve desired color outcomes while minimizing environmental impact.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Expected Outcomes</h2>
    <p>
        The project aims to provide textile manufacturers with sustainable alternatives to conventional dyeing methods. By utilizing natural pigments and eco-friendly processes, we anticipate reducing water consumption, minimizing pollution, and promoting biodiversity conservation. Additionally, textiles dyed using sustainable techniques are expected to appeal to environmentally conscious consumers, driving market demand for eco-friendly products.
